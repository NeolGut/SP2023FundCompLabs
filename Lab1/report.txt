For part 2, I chose to make a Pythagorean theorem calculator which takes input from
legs a and b and solves for the hypotenuse, c.

the program takes two inputs from the user and inserts them into an addition equation between
two pow() commands which raises the numbers to the second power. Then after adding, it square 
roots the sum and prints the answer. All numbers are in float since we are using the sqrt() 
function. 

I tested it by using an online scientific calculator and compared the results. There are cases
where it is not as precise as the scientific calculator due to the limitations of float types.
